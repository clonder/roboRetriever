# üêæ Robo Retriever

---

## üßæ Project Description

This project aims to develop **Robo Retriever**, a four-legged robotic dog controlled via Wi-Fi, to explore and demonstrate principles of computer architecture. Using a microcontroller, we will program the robot to execute movement commands, leveraging instruction cycles, control signals, and memory management techniques. By building and testing the robot, our team will gain hands-on experience with embedded systems, hardware interfacing, and real-time data processing.

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### 3D Printing and Assembly

- **3D Design / Printing**: Design and print robot parts such as the frame and servo mounts.
- **Robot Frame Assembly**: Assemble the 3D-printed parts and verify the structural stability.

### Electronics Assembly

- **Wiring and Electronics Mounting**: Wire up the servos, ESP32, and other components.
- **Soldering**: Solder any necessary connections, particularly for servo control and power distribution.

### Programming - Wi-Fi and Server

- **ESP32 Wi-Fi Setup**: Set up ESP32 Wi-Fi configuration for connectivity.
- **WebSocket for Real-Time Control**: Enable real-time control of the robot through WebSocket.
- **Web Server and Command Handling**: Create a web server on the ESP32 to handle movement commands from the web interface.

### Programming - Interface

- **Design Web Control Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface with buttons for movement commands.
- **Link Buttons to ESP32 Commands**: Map web interface commands to ESP32 actions.
- **Device Testing**: Test the interface on various devices to ensure smooth operation.

### Programming - Servo Control

- **Servo Setup**: Configure servos on the ESP32 and write movement functions.
- **Movement Functions**: Write code for complex actions (e.g., stand, sit, walk).
- **Servo Calibration**: Test and calibrate servos to ensure accurate movements.
